# Agenda

## How to use this system
* Run the AgendaUI.cpp
* Use the system by the tips shown in the UI.
* The html files in AgendaSimpleGUI is not connected with the data base, so just look at it but can't not take place of AagendaUI.cpp

## What have I done in the codes
  I wrote the codes and it can realize following functions:
  1. Register user accout;
  2. Login user accout;
  3. creat meeting;
  4. query meeting;
  5. Invite another user to attend the meeting;
  6. delete meeting;
  7. delete user accout;
* All datas will be collected in **User.csv** and **Meeting.csv** .
